This is a simple hosts file generator to block ads servers, malware websites and
more.

The `Makefile` will download and concatenate various hosts files found around
the web as well as custom made additional filters.

The `base` folder contains a list of URLs to get the generic hosts files from.
Those hosts files are mostly ads, malware, scam, spy, tracking websites.

The `extensions` folder contains a collection of hosts files organised in an
intuitive way, that allow you to block most social media, gambling and shocking
websites to protect yourself and your family from contemporary degeneracy.

You can select which extensions you want by editing the `select` file. For
example, if you want to block all malware and spying websites, plus facebook,
your `select` file should look like:

```
base/
extensions/social/fb
```

If you want to block all porn and social media:

```
base/
extensions/social
extensions/porn
```

You can refine your choice by allowing some websites within a banned category,
by editing the `unselect` file. For example, with the previous example you
wouldn't have access to whatsapp web. If you want to restore access to only
whatsapp, your `unselect` file should look like:

```
extensions/social/whatsapp
```

Once you have edited your `select` and `unselect` files, to generate and install
the hosts file, simply type:

```
sudo make install
```
